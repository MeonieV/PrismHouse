     <p>The meaning of colour differentiates from preson to person. Each color could also have contradicting feelings. Like red could be either love or hate.
     Many people would say yellow is happiness while others say its distrust.</p>
     <p>The prism house sees each colour as something rare and important. We might see it all the time but thats because there are so many. Colours keep the world
     interesting and joyful. That's why we all feel excited and in awe when we see a rainbow.</p>
     <p>No rainbow is the same as the other, and no two people see the same rainbow. Why are rainbow's so rare? If they were common we would appreciete them less,
     they would become something we see every now and then. It will lose the wonder. It is also appreciated more after a harsh storm. So come on here to calm down
     from your day to day life and enjoy a colourful blast with us.</p>
